# Branch Purpose

This branch was made in order to implement and test JUnit's DynamicTests

## Changes made from last commit

- Removed unecessary comments


## Next tasks

- Add functionality to check for if a property is a class or an interface

- AssignmentJava uses generateTests as opposed to generateTest. Must determine what to do about this (AssignmentJava implements Testable so it must implement generateTest

- **Must merge with master branch**
